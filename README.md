# native-pokemon

The purpose of this app is to create a simple app that basically lists all the monsters of Pok√©mon and displays some information when yoy click on the cards.

It displays a list of scrollable items, each item contains the pokemon's name and the back image.

When an item is pressed it shows some info related to the pokemon, the front image and it makes the cry sound associated.

You can search pokemons by its name in the Search bar and you will obtain a filtered list automatically.
